# AWS Node HTTP API with Cognito Authorizer

This example demonstrates how you can use the new AWS HTTP API (Announced Dec. 2019) and the built in JSON Web Token Authorization it offers. In this case, I've shown how to do so using Amazon Cognito. 

For more details, and more information on how to use tools like Auth0 instead of Cognito, you can review the blog post [here](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-auth-with-aws-http-apis).
